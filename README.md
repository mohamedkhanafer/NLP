I here share some codes that I have used during my Natural Language Processing course at IE Univesity.

# 1. Calculating the Lexical Diversity of songs
I came accross an article discussing the overall vocabulary of some musicians accross their careers. And so I wanted to compare some of the songs of the top 3 artists on that list and the last 2 artists to the 3 songs we saw in class.
On top of the list is (with no surprise) Eminem, which used around 8,800 words in his 100 lenghtiest songs. Then come Jay Z (6,900 words) and Tupac Shakur (6,600 words). On the bottom of the list come the Spice Girls and Bruno Mars (around 1500 words).
I tried to choose songs that seemed more lexically diverse and as expected, the results showed a large diversity difference between the two groups and also when compared to the 3 songs we saw. (the code can be found the the file 1_Lexical_Diversity)
